The Data for Utility Bussiness Model is obtained from [**U.S. Energy Information Administration**](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/56?agg=0,1&geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&endsec=vg&freq=A&start=2001&end=2019&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0) 

The Data for Utility Bussiness Model is obtained from [**Edison International 2019 Annual Finanacial Report**](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/56?agg=0,1&geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&endsec=vg&freq=A&start=2001&end=2019&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0) 

The Model is implemented in *Vensim PLE* and **PYSD** is used for running it.

For now, I'm just experimenting with **PYSD** and its interface with *Vensim*
